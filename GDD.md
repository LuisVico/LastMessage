# LAST MESSAGE – Game Design Document
*Version*: 0.3  
*Date*: 2025-06-06

## High Concept
“Last Message” is a real‑time psychological‑thriller played entirely through a lifelike messaging app.  
Players guide **Leo (16)** via text as he hides from an intruder at home, balancing *information quality* vs *time/risk*.  

## Pillars
1. **Family bond > stranger** – protect your younger brother.
2. **Time is the enemy** – every extra character risks detection.
3. **Dynamic AI** – no two play‑throughs exactly alike.

## Core Loop
1. **Freeze‑frame**: player reads + plans (clock paused).  
2. **Choice / free‑type**: communicates advice.  
3. **Danger‑time**: clock runs; Leo executes; world reacts.  

## Failure / Win States
* Safe escape → Lawn Ending  
* Intruder confrontation → Variable fail endings  

## Meta‑Systems
* **Panic (0‑2)** – affects Leo’s clarity, voice, options.  
* **Flags** – `has_weapon`, `is_aggressive` … to gate branches.
