# Last Message - Project Files

This project contains the complete, AI-powered prototype for the narrative thriller game "Last Message."

## Project Structure

- **`index.html`**: This is the main file. It contains the complete game, including the HTML structure for the UI, the Tailwind CSS for styling, and the JavaScript game engine with the narrative script and AI integration.

- **`assets/` (Placeholder)**: This project does not contain the final audio and visual assets. For now, system messages and image placeholders are used. In a full production, you would create two subdirectories:
  - `assets/audio/`: To hold all the sound effects and voice clips.
  - `assets/images/`: To hold all the photos Leo sends.

## How to Run the Prototype

1.  **Save the file:** Copy the entire contents of the `index.html` code block above and save it as a file named `index.html`.
2.  **Open in Browser:** Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.
3.  **Play:** The game will start immediately. You can interact with it by clicking the suggestion bubbles or by typing your own commands into the text box and pressing Enter or the send button.

**Note on AI Functionality:** The free-text input requires an active internet connection to communicate with the Google AI API. If you are offline, the free-text input will not work.
